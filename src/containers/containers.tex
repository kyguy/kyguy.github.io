\section{Overview}

\hspace{3pc} 
In order for applications to run on cloud platforms such as OpenShift, they must be ”containerized”. 
Moreover, these applications must be rewritten, generated, or transported into isolated programming 
environments known as containers. A container is essentially an isolated userspace containing its 
own read/write filesystem, processes, network ports, and libraries. By relying on the functionality 
of their host's kernel, containers save on resource costs, earning the trait of being "lightweight".

  \tikzstyle{image} = [c_full, fill=white!20, opacity=0.5]
  \tikzstyle{mw} = [minimum width=10.0cm]
  \tikzstyle{mh} = [minimum height=3.5cm]
  \tikzstyle{link} = [-, thick, opacity=0.3]

  \node[USR_LAYER, mw, mh] (USR) {};
  \node[KRN_LAYER, mw, below = 0cm and 0cm of USR.south] (KRN) {Kernel};
  \node[HW_LAYER,  mw, below = 0cm and 0cm of KRN.north, anchor=north] (HW) {Hardware};

  %\node[OS_LAYER, above=1cm of USR.south] (OS) {\Large \color{white} OpenShift};
  \node [below = 0cm of HW.south] (HM) {Physical Machine};
  \path[->, thin, to path={-| (\tikztotarget)}]
    (HM.west) edge (HW.south west)
    (HM.east) edge (HW.south east);

  \node[box, minimum height = 1.75cm, minimum width = 5.5cm, DK_COLOR, below = -1.0cm of USR.center,
       label={[label distance=-0.65cm]270:Container Engine}] (DK) {};
  \containers{0}{8}{8}{above left= 0.75cm and 2cm of DK.south};

With little expense, containers can be instantiated, snapshotted, and destroyed quickly. Moreover, 
containers are 
ideal for developing applications. By providing applications with their own isolated programming 
environment, containers help users avoid problems like dependency and networking collisions. 
Accidentally downloading conflicting libraries or necromancing zombie network ports need not result 
in tedious environment debugging when developing in a container. Remember, containers are inexpensive,
 they can be destroyed and then recreated on a whim.

\subsection{Container Management}
One can manage these virtual userspaces using the container interface application known as Moby. 
Moby uses features built in the kernel to organize, isolate, create, save, and destroy containers. 
Friends running Moby on their machine can easily share their applications with other friends running 
Moby. These packaged applications not only deliver the same executing code of the developer but also 
the same environment that executing code was running in. All libraries and environmental variables 
are installed and ready to go. This way, more time can be spent creating the application as opposed 
to debugging environmental infestations.

\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 1cm and 0cm]
      \tikzstyle{mw} = [minimum width=4.0cm]

      \moby{0}{4}{4}{};
      \node[HM_LAYER, mw, below= 0cm of DK_0.south, anchor=north] (HM_0) {Host Machine 0};
      
      \moby{1}{2}{2}{right= 0cm and 1cm of DK_0};
      \node[HM_LAYER, mw, below= 0cm of DK_1.south, anchor=north] (HM_1) {Host Machine 1};
      
      \moby{2}{1}{1}{right= 0cm and 1cm of DK_1};
      \node[HM_LAYER, mw, below= 0cm of DK_2.south, anchor=north] (HM_2) {Host Machine 2};
      
      \path[->, bend left=45] (C5_0) edge (C1_1);
      \path[->, bend left=45] (C6_0) edge (C0_2);
      \path[->, bend left=45] (C7_0) edge (C0_1);
      
      \node[] (C_LABEL_1) {};
      
\end{tikzpicture}

In contrast to virtual machines, containers are classified under operating system level virtualization
 because they rely on the operating system resources of their host machine. Virtual machines 
rely on hardware virtualization which has a higher virtual memory management cost than operating 
system virtualization. Intuitively, this makes sense. It is more expensive to replicate the hardware 
and operating system for a virtual machine than it is to instantiate an isolated userspace for a 
container. Although containers provide less isolation than virtual machines, they consume 
significantly less resources. This is why containers are viewed as being "light weight". 
In fact, it is even possible for a single physical machine to host hundreds containers simultaneously.
