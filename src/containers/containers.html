<p>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;            In order for applications to run on cloud platforms such as OpenShift,
they must be containerized. Moreover, these applications must be rewritten,
generated, or transported into isolated programming environments known as
containers. A container is essentially an isolated userspace containing its own
read/write filesystem, processes, network ports, and libraries. By relying on the
functionality of their host&#8217;s kernel, containers save on resource costs, earning the trait
of being &#8221;lightweight&#8221;. </p>

<p>   With little expense, containers can be instantiated, snapshotted, and destroyed
quickly. Moreover, containers are ideal for developing applications. By providing
applications with their own isolated programming environment, containers help users
avoid problems like dependency and networking collisions. Accidentally downloading
conflicting libraries or necromancing zombie network ports need not result in
tedious environment debugging when developing in a container. Remember,
containers are inexpensive, they can be destroyed and then recreated on a
whim.

<p>One can manage these virtual userspaces using the container interface application
known as Moby. Moby uses features built in the kernel to organize, isolate, create,
save, and destroy containers. Friends running Moby on their machine can easily
share their applications with other friends running Moby. These packaged
applications not only deliver the same executing code of the developer but also the
same environment that executing code was running in. All libraries and
environmental variables are installed and ready to go. This way, more time can
be spent creating the application as opposed to debugging environmental
infestations.

<p>   In contrast to virtual machines, containers are classified under operating system
level virtualization because they rely on the operating system resources of their host
machine. Virtual machines rely on hardware virtualization which has a higher virtual
memory management cost than operating system virtualization. Intuitively, this
makes sense. It is more expensive to replicate the hardware and operating system for
a virtual machine than it is to instantiate an isolated userspace for a container.
Although containers provide less isolation than virtual machines, they consume
significantly less resources. This is why containers are viewed as being &#8221;light weight&#8221;.
In fact, it is even possible for a single physical machine to host hundreds containers
simultaneously.
