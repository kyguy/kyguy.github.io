\section{Overview}

\hspace{3pc} Leveraging container technology, Red Hat's Cloud Enablment(CE) team has developed a test suite to accelerate and stabilize the development of its middleware products. It is now far easier than before to create, test, and deploy middleware applications on the cloud. To harness the full power of this test suite, users should understand its architecture. This document serves as a basic overview of that architecture and its underlying mechanics.

% CONTAINER TECHNOLOGY
%================================================
\section{Container technology}
%\hspace{3pc} 
In order for applications to run on cloud platforms such as OpenShift, they must be "containerized". Moreover, these applications must be rewritten, generated, or transported into
isolated programming environments known as containers. 
%================================================
% CONTAINERS
%================================================
\subsection{Containers}

%\hspace{3pc}
A container is essentially an isolated userspace containing its own read/write filesystem, processes, network ports, and libraries. By relying on the functionality of their host's kernel, containers save on resource costs, earning the trait of being "lightweight". With little expense, containers can be instantiated, snapshotted, and destroyed quickly. Moreover, containers are ideal for developing applications. By providing applications with their own isolated programming environment, containers help users avoid problems like dependency and networking collisions. Accidentally downloading conflicting libraries or necromancing zombie network ports need not result in tedious environment debugging when developing in a container. Remember, containers are inexpensive, they can be destroyed and then recreated on a whim.

\subsection{Container Management}
One can manage these userspaces using the container interface application known as Moby. Moby uses features built in the kernel to organize, isolate, create, save, and destroy containers. Friends running Moby on their machine can easily share their applications with other friends running Moby. These packaged applications not only deliver the same executing code of the developer but also the same environment that executing code was running in. All libraries and environmental variables are installed and ready to go. This way, more time can be spent creating the application as opposed to debugging environmental infestations.

\caption{Sharing Containers with Friends} 
\end{figure}
In contrast to virtual machines, containers are classified under operating system level virtualization because they rely on the operating system resources of their host machine. Virtual machines rely on hardware virtualization which has a higher virtual memory management cost than operating system virtualization. Intuitively, this makes sense. It is more expensive to replicate the hardware and operating system for a virtual machine than it is to instantiate an isolated userspace for a container. Although containers provide less isolation than virtual machines, they consume significantly less resources. This is why containers are viewed as being "light weight". In fact, it is even possible for a single physical machine to host hundreds containers simultaneously. %However, as one can imagine, this can become difficult to manage.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Application Management
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Application Management}
Although containers simulate individual userspaces they don't behave exactly like userspace when it comes to networking, storage, and memory management. Every container management platform introduces its own set of peculiarities and this can be confusing for experienced programmers. OpenShift attempts to simplify these nuances to enable programmers to reap the benefits of container technology without knowing a lot about it. OpenShift does this providing its own building block abstraction as well as tools to manipulate them. OpenShift organizes containers into what are known as pods. At its heart, a pod is just a grouping of isolated processes that emulate a virtual operating system. Pods have their own ip address and storage; moreover, pods can host shell sessions, websites, and provide many of the functionalities that fully functioning operating systems do. Just like containers, pods reuse the resources of its host to make these things possile.

\caption{Anatomy of a Pod}
\end{figure}

A containerized application running on OpenShift is broken down into a set of pods. Typically, each pod serves a distinct purpose. For a toy example, imagine that a programmer wanted to create an chatbot. The programmer might decide to keep the executing application code in one pod, the data in another, and the source code for building the first two pods in a third pod. By dividing the application's parts into separate pods, the programmer would be abstracting much of the memory, networking, and hardware management by relying on OpenShift's tools. If the programmer wants to expand the bot to other physical machines, the third pod, the App Builder, will create and distribute the necessary parts across the other hosts. If the application pod is hacked, OpenShift will destroy the infected pod and instantiate a fresh application pod in its place. With the data on a separate pod, it is innately isolated but also restrictively connected to the bot. The compromisation of a pod stops at that pod and the application remains safe. All of the pods are choreographed to functional properly as a whole without hesitation while individual pods are instantiated, terminated, altered, or scaled.

\caption{Example an Containerized Application running on OpenShift}
\end{figure}

It is common for pods to have one container running the logic of the application and clone of that container in case the first goes down. This method minimizes the downtime of an application. Although the containers of a pod must coexist on the same physical host, pods of an application can be scheduled and dispersed among other physical hosts. This has the advantage of matching a pod's functionality with hardware strengths of its host. For instance, in the chatbot example the programmer might schedule the chatbot application pod running expensive neural net computation on a a phisical host that has powerful GPUs. Then schedule the database pod on another physical host which has lots of random access memory for faster reads and writes of accumulated data. In order to organize a programmer's pods across hosts and decrease the scope of applications running on the same OpenShift cluster, OpenShift provides application blinders known as "namespaces". Namespaces can help a user avoid application service and naming collisions and keep OpenShift environments clean.

With namespaces, it is easier for a team of programmers to manage, interact, and program their applications in a common environment. Every member could be working on a different chatbot with similar components, using the same user account names for databases or referenceing the same user ids in programs and the namespaces will keep these projects divided.

@Test <---- Runs on client
public void testRestService() throws Exception {
  String host = System.getenv("DATAGRID_APP_SERVICE_HOST");
  int port = Integer.parseInt(System.getenv("DATAGRID_APP_SERVICE_PORT"));
  RESTCache<String, Object> cache = new RESTCache<>("default", new URL("http://" + host + ":" + port), "rest");

\begin{lstlisting}
|@Test|   
|@RunAsClient|
|@InSequence(1)|
public void testCarMartApp() throws Exception {
  Car car = new Car("test", 0.0, CarType.SEDAN, "test", "test", Country.USA);
  client = HttpClientBuilder.untrustedConnectionClient();
  addCar(car);
	assertCarsAreSame(car, getCar(car));
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Before we dive into the details of the testsuite, we must first understand the Arquillian components. When maven builds an application, it spawns two JVMs; one for the testrunner and one for the tests. Take the following example for example

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Java]
|@Test|    <-------------- Local Test
|@RunAsClient|
|@InSequence(1)|
public void testCarMartApp() throws Exception {
  Car car = new Car("test", 0.0, CarType.SEDAN, "test", "test", Country.USA);
  client = HttpClientBuilder.untrustedConnectionClient();
  addCar(car);
	assertCarsAreSame(car, getCar(car));
}
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{lstlisting}
|@RunWith|(Arquillian.class)
|@Template|(url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jboss-openshift/application-templates/master/datagrid/datagrid65-basic.json")
|@RoleBinding|(roleRefName = "view", userName = "system:serviceaccount:\${kubernetes.namespace}:jdg-service-account")
|@OpenShiftResources|({
  |@OpenShiftResource|("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\${template.repository:jboss-openshift}/application-templates/\${template.branch:master}/secrets/datagrid-app-secret.json")
})
public class JdgBasicTest extends JdgTestBase {
  |@Deployment|
  public static WebArchive getDeployment() {
    return getDeploymentInternal();
  }
}
