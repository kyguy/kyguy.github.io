<p>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;            Leveraging container technology, Red Hat&#8217;s Cloud Enablment(CE) team
has developed a test suite to accelerate and stabilize the development of its
middleware products. It is now far easier than before to create, test, and deploy
middleware applications on the cloud. To harness the full power of this test suite,
users should understand its architecture. This document serves as a basic overview of
that architecture and its underlying mechanics.

 id="x1-2000"></a>Container technology</h3>
<p>In order for applications to run on cloud platforms such as OpenShift, they
must be &#8221;containerized&#8221;. Moreover, these applications must be rewritten,
generated, or transported into isolated programming environments known as
containers.
   </p> 

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">   </span> <a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Containers</h4>
<p>A container is essentially an isolated userspace containing its own read/write
filesystem, processes, network ports, and libraries. By relying on the functionality of
their host&#8217;s kernel, containers save on resource costs, earning the trait of being
&#8221;lightweight&#8221;. With little expense, containers can be instantiated, snapshotted, and
destroyed quickly. Moreover, containers are ideal for developing applications. By
providing applications with their own isolated programming environment, containers
help users avoid problems like dependency and networking collisions. Accidentally
downloading conflicting libraries or necromancing zombie network ports need not
result in tedious environment debugging when developing in a container. Remember,
containers are inexpensive, they can be destroyed and then recreated on a
whim.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">   </span> <a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>Container Management</h4>
<p>One can manage these userspaces using the container interface application known as
Docker. Docker uses features built in the kernel to organize, isolate, create, save,
and destroy containers. Friends running Docker on their machine can easily
share their applications with other friends running Docker. These packaged
applications not only deliver the same executing code of the developer but also the
same environment that executing code was running in. All libraries and
environmental variables are installed and ready to go. This way, more time can
be spent creating the application as opposed to debugging environmental
infestations.

<p>   In contrast to virtual machines, containers are classified under operating system
level virtualization because they rely on the operating system resources of their host
machine. Virtual machines rely on hardware virtualization which has a higher virtual
memory management cost than operating system virtualization. Intuitively, this
makes sense. It is more expensive to replicate the hardware and operating system for
a virtual machine than it is to instantiate an isolated userspace for a container.
Although containers provide less isolation than virtual machines, they consume
significantly less resources. This is why containers are viewed as being &#8221;light&#8221;. In
fact, it is even possible for a single physical machine to host hundreds containers
simultaneously.

<p>   Openshift organizes containers into groups specific for applications. These
groupings of containers are known as pods. Most of the operations which Openshift
will preform are upon pods for easier management and groupings. A pod must have
at least one container and pods are the smallest unit with which openShift can
manipulate. </p>
